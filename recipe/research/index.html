                <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/apple-pie-from-scratch">Tasty</a> is a great recipe website inspiration because they don't have any fluffer text before the recipe like most recipe websites do where you have to scroll down endlessly to find the instructions. Once you are on a specific recipe page, the ingredients are on the left and the instructions are on the right, allowing for quick communication and minimal scrolling.

                <a href="https://themodernproper.com/broccoli-pesto-pasta">The Modern Proper</a> recipe pages are good references because it shows you the rating, title, and image of the final product right on the landing page.

                <a href="https://wovenmagazine.com/">Woven Magazine</a> has a very simplistic and minimalistic design on their website. As you scroll down the landing page, the blog articles are shon in two columns with an image, the title, and a one sentence description about each article. It makes for a very pleasant navigation experience.

                <a href="https://www.gucci.com/us/en/">Gucci</a>'s website is one of my favorites because of the floating centered text on the background images and videos and as you scroll down, there are one-word descriptions for each category along with a button to shop that category. It makes it very easy to find what you're shopping for or even just to peruse the clean looking site.

                <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>'s website is very inviting and friendly-looking. This is important for a language learning website because it is often challenging and off-putting to learn a new language. Duolingo's website is full of soft corner buttons and whimsical sans serifs that make the reader feel welcome and more inclined to keep reading the content.
