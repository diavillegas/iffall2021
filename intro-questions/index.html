                <h3>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h3>
            </dt>
                <p><dd>I specialize in graphic design, marketing, and textile design. I am interested in this class 
            because I want to learn how to code for websites, and find out the behind the scenes of what 
            makes a successful site!</dd></p>

                <h3>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h3>
            </dt>
            <p><dd>Senior year of high school I took AP Computer Science, which only taught us Java and how to 
            compile code at the very basics with if/then statements and so on, but I'm ready to delve deeper!</dd></p>

                <h3>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
            </dt>
        <p><dd>I want to learn how to make very interactive websites with images, multiple pages, 
            and just the general process of website building. </dd></p>

            <dt>
                <h3>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3>
            </dt>
        <p><dd>I expect that designing for a screen will have to take into account what kind of screen is being used, whether 
            it be mobile, desktop, ipad, etc. and how to make a seamless experience regardless of the size.</dd></p>

                <h3>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3>
            </dt>
        <p><dd>
            The <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a> website exemplifies effective design to me because they use large
            images with minimal text to show off their products, all the text uses the same two fonts for continuity, and
            all the buttons are conveniently placed.</dd></p>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                <h3>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h3>
            </dt>
        <p><dd>
            The <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> website exemplifies clear communication to me due to the fact that from 
            simply looking at the landing page and scrolling down, I already know all of the products that Apple offers. The website 
            is simple, very easy to navigate, and gets straight to the point with consice subtitles.</p></dd>

                <h3>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
            </dt>
        <p><dd>The <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> website works very well. This is because as soon as 
        you arrive at the landing page, there is a big text box to insert the location where you're looking to move. After
        the location found, the screen splits into two halves where the left side shows a map of the area with available homes as dots, and the
        right side shows profiles of each home with an image, the price, and the exact address. This makes the search process very easy 
        as the user can reference both sides of the screen at the same time with minimal effort.</p></dd>
